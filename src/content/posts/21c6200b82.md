Every Pink Floyd fan can surely remember their blockbuster hit "Another Brick in the Wall.". The haunting melody, pulsating disco beats and the unforgettable children’s choir echoing “We don’t need no education,” - all hallmark of a true rock n' roll classic. Perhaps the cherry on top was having this historical success become a protest song against rigid and abusive schooling, a worldwide thumb to authoritarian education systems. But the story behind the children who made that choir iconic brings its share of controversy.

**A Surprise Choir Session**

In 1979, the bright minds of Islington Green School had no idea they were going to be part of rock history. An innovative music teacher decided to upend the typical school routine and take the fourth-form choir to a local recording studio. The result? An infusion of youthful rebelliousness into Pink Floyd's soon-to-be hit song.

**A Shocking Reality**

As "Another Brick in the Wall" ascended charts and hit airwaves worldwide, the adults in charge expressed shock and horror. The song's bold content, questioning the necessity of rigorously structured education, didn't sit well with the very system it was criticizing.

The head teacher at Islington Green School, startled by the song's message, enforced a strict ban. The young choir was not allowed to perform on TV shows like "Top of the Pops" or even be featured in Pink Floyd's music video. The chorus of protest, it appeared, was too vociferous for the administration to swallow. The school was gifted with a £1,000 cheque for their contribution. But the choir members received a shiny round zero in royalties despite their youthful vocals stealing the show!

**A Late Paycheck**

Fast forward what must have felt like epochs for these choristers, and their payday finally arrived. About 25 years after the release of "Another Brick in the Wall", the unsung heroes, the kids from Islington Green School, finally laid claim to their royalties.

This payment came decades after the song collected so many accolades - including chart-toppers in 14 countries, over four million copies sold, a Grammy nomination, and ranking number 384 on Rolling Stone's list of "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". All this while the kids stuck with their day jobs!

Yet, even their late payday was not without controversy. Since the 1979 recording, many have graduated, moved on, and perhaps given less thought to their childhood claim to fame. Yet, their passion and sentiment from those recording studio days remained strong. After a long wait, the royalties rewarded their contribution, finally acknowledging their involvement in making rock history. 

**TL;DR**

Rock n' roll school was in session when a gutsy music teacher took his choir to a local recording studio in 1979. For the kids of Islington Green School, this meant unwittingly becoming part of Pink Floyd's historic hit "Another Brick in the Wall". However, the unexpected stars were forbidden from public appearances due to the song’s controversial content - and they didn't see a penny from their performance. But hold the phones - after 25 years, the choir finally got their deserved royalties, albeit with the predictable dash of controversy.

Prompting us to think: Is it ever too late to do the right thing? Or is the tardiness just another brick in the wall of injustice in the music industry? What do you think?
